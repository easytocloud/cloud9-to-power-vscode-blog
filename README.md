## Changes

The original version of this code was a great inspriration for this fork. Why This fork? It

* fixes a bug or two
* automates some mandatory changes on the Cloud9 instance
* integrates the solution with easytocloud's aws-profile-organizer
* adds homebrew installation convinience

An other bug fix (not mine) is also available in an existing merge request on the original repo.
The other features are not so generic that many others would benefit.

Note, ssm-proxy is the original name, aws-proxy is the name used in this repo
